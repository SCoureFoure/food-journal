# Known anchors (resource-id) — registry

The map of every `Semantics(identifier: …)` anchor in the app. **This file is the
single source of truth.** Two consumers read it:

- **Explore rig** (ADB / UIAutomator) — taps by `resource-id`; some ids are absorbed
  by their Material widget and need a documented fallback (see ✱).
- **Dart `integration_test`** — reads ids in-process; absorbed ids work fine here.

Register every new anchor here in the same commit that adds it (the trail-blaze rule
in `.claude/skills/explore/SKILL.md` Step 6 and the `/spec` loop Step 5b).

**Canonical vs view.** This registry is canonical: it holds the full row (screen ·
meaning · ✱/fallback) and is the one home for **shared-widget** anchors that span
screens (e.g. `log-meal-input`, `btn-autofill-*` from `LogDescriptionSection`). A
feature spec's `## Anchors` section is a *view* — it lists only the ids that feature
touches and links back here; it does not redefine meaning or fallback.

Symptom chips have no anchor — tap by `content-desc="<SymptomName>"`.

## Legend

⚠ = anchor defined in script scenario but not yet added to Flutter widget. Add
`Semantics(identifier: 'id')` to the relevant widget before relying on it.

✱ = `Semantics(identifier:)` is set but the Material widget (FAB/Slider) merges its
own semantics over it, so the id does NOT surface as a resource-id. Tap via ui.xml
bounds (clickable/SeekBar node) or `content-desc` instead. The id still works for
Dart `integration_test` in-process — declared + reach documented is the bar, not
ADB-tappable.

## Adding anchors to new screens

When you build a new screen or navigate somewhere new:

1. Wrap the screen's root or key interactive widget with `Semantics(identifier: 'screen-name')`.
2. Add the anchor to the table above.
3. Add a scenario function in `test_explore.ps1` if it needs multi-step navigation.
